Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to create a line of three of your own symbols (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid.

Game Board: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players: There are two players in the game, typically represented by "X" and "O."
Turns: Players take turns to place their symbol ("X" or "O") on an empty cell of the grid.
Objective: The goal is to create a line of three of your own symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Winning: The player who successfully forms a line of three of their symbols is declared the winner.
Draw/Tie: If the entire grid is filled, and no player has formed a winning line, the game is a draw or tie.
Blocking Opponent: Players often strategically place their symbols to block their opponent from forming a winning line.
Continuation: The game can be played in multiple rounds, and players take turns going first.
