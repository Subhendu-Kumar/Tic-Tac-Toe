Game Board: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players: There are two players in the game, typically represented by "X" and "O."

Objective: The goal is to create a line of three of your own symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Winning: The player who successfully forms a line of three of their symbols is declared the winner.
Draw/Tie: If the entire grid is filled, and no player has formed a winning line, the game is a draw or tie.
Blocking Opponent: Players often strategically place their symbols to block their opponent from forming a winning line.
